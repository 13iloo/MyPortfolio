# CraftoReplica

This project is a fully responsive, feature-complete replica of [https://crafto.themezaa.com/](https://crafto.themezaa.com/) built using React, CSS, and Bootstrap. It aims to maintain identical layout, animations, typography styles, section ordering, and interaction patterns, replacing copyrighted images/text with placeholders.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd craftoreplica
    ```

    *(Note: Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository if you are cloning it from a remote source. If you are already in the project directory, you can skip this step.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This will install all the necessary project dependencies, including React, Bootstrap, GSAP, Swiper.js, and Font Awesome.

## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will:
- Start the development server.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your default web browser.
- Automatically reload the page when you make changes to the code.

## Deployment

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will:
- Create a `build` folder containing the optimized, minified, and production-ready static files.
- These files can then be deployed to any static site hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

For detailed deployment instructions, refer to the documentation of your chosen hosting platform.
